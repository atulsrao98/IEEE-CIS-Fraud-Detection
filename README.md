# IEEE CIS Fraud Detection Challenge 
The IEEE Computational Society recently hosted a competition on Kaggle to imporve the accuracy of determining fradulent transactions. 

## GETTING STARTED 
The dataset required for this challenge can be found at : https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/data

## PREREQUISITES
The Algorithm utilized in this solution of the challenge is the 'Extreme Gradient Boosting' or XGBoost Algorithm.\
It is a decision tree based ensemble learning algorithm that works extremely well with tabular data.

## INSTALLATION 
### 1. XGBoost 
~ pip install xgboost 
### 2. FASTAI
Requirements:\
